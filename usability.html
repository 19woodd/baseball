<div class="unit">METHOD</div>
<p class="reflection">We studied three websites: Bordentown Regional School District's site, aimed at students and parents; 
Yale's art division site, aimed at art students; and the TSA website, aimed at members of the TSA program. 
We had the users find an Algebra teacher's contact information, Summer Art Program information, and TSA venue 
and contact information, respectively.</p>
<div class="unit">RESULTS</div>
<p class="reflection">The results we obtained varied, from being fairly straightforward and quick in regards to the Bordentown site, 
exceedingly difficult and slow to navigate the Yale site, and somewhat simple and quick to use the TSA site, although slightly confusing to find 
certain information.</p>
<div class="unit">DISCUSSION</div>
<p class="reflection">From this activity we learned the importance of fast, easy-to-learn design in order to optimize our 
websites for usability. By making important information clear to the user through good design principles, we can achieve 
a high quality level of usabiltiy.</p>
