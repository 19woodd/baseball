		<h4>By Richard Greco, Kevin Minnick and Joe Zedalis</h4>
		<p >Second-seeded Bordentown rallied for seven runs in the bottom of the sixth inning and staved off an upset big by No. 15 Bernards, scoring a 15-9 victory. The victory moved Bordentown (17-5) into the CJ2 quarterfinal opposite No. 7 Raritan. Raritan was a 1-0 winner over Shore Conference divisional rival Rumson-Fair Haven Monday. Bordentown finished with 14 hits. It also took advantage of four Bernards errors. Dillon Drew hit a three-run homer for Bordentown. Ryan Gronostajski added a three-run double and Johnny Schroeder had three RBI for the Scotties. Bordentown took the lead when George Kalargheros was hit by a pitch in the sixth.</p>

		<h4>By Sean Miller</h4>
		<p >Kyle Marchetti, Johnny Schroeder, and the rest of the Bordentown (16-5) baseball team already have two trophies this season.
		<br/>
		Now, the Scotties will go in search of two more, to make the 2018 campaign one for the ages.
		<br/>
		Bordentown is the second seed in NJSIAA Central Jersey, Group 2, the highest seed of any Times of Trenton area team. The Scotties, who have won at least a share of the Burlington County Scholastic League Patriot Division title, and picked up the BCSL Tournament title last week with a 3-0 win over Delran, will now try to win a sectional title.
		<br/>
		Bordentown will take on 15th-seeded Bernards (4-14) Monday, in first round play. The only team seeded higher than the Scotties in the Central Jersey, Group 2 bracket is top-seeded Gov. Livingston (20-2-1), which is ranked number four in the NJ.com rankings. But each team has to win three games to get there, so Bordentown will be focused on one game at a time.
		<br/>
		"We feel really good going into the state tournament, but we realize it takes one game at a time to achieve our ultimate goal," Marchetti, who is 6-1 as the ace of the Bordentown staff, said. "So that is what we are going to do, take it one game at a time."
		<br/>
		"We feel confident that we can beat any team we step on the field with," Schroeder (.422, 31 runs) said. "We are going to play every inning in the tournament with full intensity."</p>
		
		<h3><a href="http://highschoolsports.nj.com/news/article/6529188118083374894/baseball-marchetti-wins-the-duel-as-bordentown-captures-bcsl-tourney-title/">Baseball: Marchetti Wins the Duel as Bordentown Captures BCSL Tournament Title</a></h3>
		<h4>By Kevin Minnick</h4>
		<p >It was a pitcher’s duel at its finest.
		<br/>
		Luke Smith was outstanding for Delran, while Bordentown’s Kyle Marchetti was equal to the challenge.
		<br/>
		The difference proved to be one sequence of events, with Marchetti getting the help at the plate he needed.
		<br/>
		Dylan Wood’s RBI double in the fourth broke the ice, while two more runs came in on the same play. The three-run outburst would be all Bordentown could generate but it proved to be enough for a 3-0 victory Thursday night over Delran and the Burlington County Scholastic League Tournament championship.
		<br/>
		“Games like tonight are only going to help us moving forward,” Bordentown coach Chris Glenn said.
		<br/>
		It was the third game this season between the two teams, with Delran earning a 1-0 victory Tuesday. This time around, Marchetti put the Scotties on his back.
		<br/>
		“He’s just been our bull for the past three years,” Glenn said. “He bounced back because last week against Holy Cross he had a bit of a rough outing. It’s good to see him get that confidence back and hop right back on the mound.”
		<br/>
		A junior, Marchetti struck out 10 and scattered four hits. He did surrender six walks, but was able to get out of any potential trouble.
		<br/>
		“My curveball was working all night,” said Marchetti, who was named the tournament MVP. “My fastball wasn’t working in the early innings, so I just needed to make some adjustments. I was able to hit the zone.
		<br/>
		“I like to trust myself and the fielders behind me. I know I can make the pitches to get us out of innings.”
		<br/>
		Bordentown (15-4) ended a three-game losing skid. The Scotties won the first matchup, 4-2 on April 19. Delran (14-4) saw its four-game winning streak snapped.
		<br/>
		Take away the fourth inning and Smith was as dominant as he’s been all season for Delran. Headed to St. Joseph’s University, the senior right-hander struck out 10 and gave up just two hits - both in the decisive inning.
		<br/>
		Ryan Gronostajski opened with a walk, while Johnny Schroeder followed with a bunt single down the third-base line. Following a strikeout, Wood smacked a double over the left fielder’s head.
		<br/>
		Gronostajski scored easily, but the ball was thrown away. That allowed Schroder to race home, while a second error on the play enabled Wood to safely score.
		<br/>
		Bordentown went down in order every other inning.
		<br/>
		“He pitched great. He deserved a lot better than what we gave him,” longtime Delran coach Rich Bender said. “That’s what we expect from him. We just have to give him better support.
		<br/>
		“You have to give (Bordentown) credit. That one inning, to score three runs like that should never happen to a team like ours. Hopefully we learn from this and we understand what it’s like to be in a big game. This is what it’s going to be like in the state tournament.”
		<br/>
		Smith shouldered some of the blame, saying: “It all started with the walk. If you walk somebody, it’s not good.
		<br/>
		“Playing them is fun because it’s always a close game. But in order to win, you can’t beat yourselves and I think we beat ourselves at the plate. We didn’t have good approaches.”
		<br/>
		Steve Ryba pitched a 1-2-3 seventh to earn the save.
		<br/>
		“We’re building toward the playoffs now and we have to play our best ball,” Glenn said. “We have to learn from the past week and some of the games that we lost.
		<br/>
		“What I like about these guys is that they play the same way regardless of the score. They work hard whether we’re up or down.”</p>
